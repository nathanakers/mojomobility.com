                            <p>Wireless charging technology provides many safety advantages over conventional cord charging. Mojo’s unique Near Field Power® system provides:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A safety advantage in waterproof or sealed environments due to the lack of connecting points that conventional cord-charging requires</li>
                                    <li>A charging surface that does not heat up metallic objects, making it a safe place to put coins and keys</li>
                                    <li>Electromagnetic emissions that conform to all regulatory guidelines</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
