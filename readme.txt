This template is built using Bootstrap 2.3, plus a few additional recommendations.

When using, you'll need to:
+ change @vars in functions.php:
    @vars have to do with site location, project names, pages, etc
+ change .htaccess:
    updating page names and page redirections
    change notes at top of .htaccess
+ change apple-touch-icon.png
    just make a new one at 144x144px. Apple will download and use that for all platforms (i think)
+ change favicon.ico
    make it 32x32px.
+ change humans.txt
    just talks of site credits and project info

Double check:
+ if redirect is correct in index.php
